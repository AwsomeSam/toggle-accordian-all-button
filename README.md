# toggle-accordian-all-button
Hi,  I find Elementor useful. But I have a question. Elementor has both "Accordion" &amp; "Toggle" widgets. I can create a list of "Accordion" or "Toggle" texts &amp; open each of the "Accordion" or "Toggle" text individually. But what if I want to open all of them at once with one click? How to do that?  Can anyone help me on this?
